# TTProfiler: Types and Terms Profile Building for Online Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graphs


As more and more knowledge graphs (KG) are published on the Web, there is a need for tools that show their content. This implies showing the schema-level patterns instantiated in the graph, but also the terms used to qualify its entities. In this paper, we present a new profiling tool that we call TTprofiler. It shows the predicates that relate types in the KG, and also the terms present in this KG, because of their paramount importance in most of KGs, especially in the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain. We recall the role of terminologies and how they are implemented and used on the Web, we give the algorithm for building a TT profile from an online KGâ€™s Endpoint, and we report on experiments performed over a set of Cultural Heritage Web KGs. A tool for visualizing TT profiles is also provided.

This Algorithm deals with online knowledge graph in order to return its profile based on its data types and terms. Into the Ouput folder, we have two files for a given knowledge graph. One of the file contains the prefixes used in the ABox and the other gives the profile described in the json format.
